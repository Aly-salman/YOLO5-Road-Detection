# YOLO5-Road-Detection
Project Overview
This report covers the process of setting up, training, and evaluating a custom YOLOv5 model for road-turn detection. The project includes dataset acquisition, model training, and object detection on validation images using the YOLOv5 model architecture.
Objectives
•	Train a YOLOv5 model for road-turn detection.
•	Evaluate model performance on a validation set.
•	Visualize and analyze detection results.
